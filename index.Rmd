This is the project site for a model Online Research Permit and Monitoring System to Support Implementation of the [Nagoya Protocol](https://www.cbd.int/abs/about/). 

The idea behind the model is to assist Parties to the [Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization](https://www.cbd.int/abs/about/) of the [United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity](https://www.cbd.int) with implementing the Nagoya Protocol. 

The model focuses on the creation of an online permit and monitoring system to make it easier for governments to administer research permit applications involving genetic resources and traditional knowledge and to monitor compliance under the Nagoya Protocol as well as making it easier to prepare national reports.

### Who Developed This? 

The original model was written by Dr. Paul Oldham as part of work with Hartmut Meyer and Olivier Rukundo on implementation of the Nagoya Protocol in the Bahamas. The updated version is a joint work in progress and much better for it.

The model was developed with the support of [The Bahamas Environment, Science & Technology Commission (BEST)](http://www.best.gov.bs) of the Government of the Bahamas under the UNEP/GEF project “Strengthening Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) in the Bahamas" as set out in *Oldham, P (2015) Concepts for an Electronic Monitoring Tool. UNEP/GEF project “Strengthening Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) in the Bahamas”*. We were able to do further work with the additional support of [The ABS Capacity Development Initiative](http://www.abs-initiative.info) through the [Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)](https://www.giz.de/en/html/index.html). We express our sincere thanks to the BEST Commission, UNEP/GEF and the ABS Capacity Development Initiative for their support. We would point out that the views expressed are solely those of the authors and should not be interpreted as reflecting the views of the Government of the Bahamas, the ABS Initiative or GIZ. Spelling mistakes, misnumberings and disasters with diagrams are definitely somebody else's fault.
